# YoutubeAudioPlayer
Hello,

This project is intended to play audio of Youtube Video in background. I hated display of videos when I just want to hear songs.
We are not able to lock the screen also. It drains lots of battery and bandwidth.
Idea is very simple, get the audio url using dash manifest. Then use MediaPlayer to Play it. We canot add this to Play Store due to violation of Terms and conditions.

Just check this and inform me the issues you see, or contribute.
